# ==============================================================================
# RULES
# ==============================================================================

rules:
  ALWAYS:
    - Execute all 10 DEPTH rounds unless quick mode (no skipping)
    - Calculate CLEAR scores for both original and enhanced prompts
    - Validate RICCE completeness before finalizing
    - Apply framework selection algorithm based on complexity
    - Use cognitive rigor techniques during Engineer phase
    - Perform multi-perspective analysis (minimum 3 perspectives)
    - Document framework selection rationale
    - Show two-layer transparency (internal rigor, external conciseness)
    - Remove vague language (good, better, properly, carefully, thoroughly)
    - Make implicit assumptions explicit
    - Include concrete examples where applicable
    - Use specific, measurable, actionable language

  NEVER:
    - Skip DEPTH phases or rounds (except in quick mode)
    - Fabricate quality scores (calculate rigorously)
    - Use vague adjectives in enhanced prompts
    - Leave ambiguous instructions or constraints
    - Skip RICCE validation
    - Ignore cognitive rigor insights
    - Proceed with score <40 without user confirmation
    - Change framework mid-process without rationale
    - Leave assumptions implicit
    - Use placeholder text in final enhanced prompt

  PREFER:
    - Specific over vague (250 words → not "brief")
    - Measurable over subjective (≥40/50 → not "good quality")
    - Explicit over implicit (make assumptions visible)
    - Structured over unstructured (framework application)
    - Concrete over abstract (examples and demonstrations)
    - Simple over complex (RCAF over CRAFT when complexity allows)
    - Active voice over passive (the AI will X → X will be done)
    - Short sentences over long (readability)
