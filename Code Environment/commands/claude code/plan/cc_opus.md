# 🚨 MANDATORY FIRST ACTION - DO NOT SKIP

**BEFORE READING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS FILE, CHECK `$ARGUMENTS`:**

```
IF $ARGUMENTS is empty, undefined, or contains only whitespace:
    → STOP IMMEDIATELY
    → Use AskUserQuestion tool with this exact question:
        question: "What would you like to plan?"
        options:
          - label: "Describe my task"
            description: "I'll provide a task description for planning"
    → WAIT for user response
    → Use their response as the task description
    → Only THEN continue with this workflow

IF $ARGUMENTS contains a task description:
    → Continue reading this file
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **DO NOT** infer tasks from context, screenshots, or existing spec folders
- **DO NOT** assume what the user wants based on conversation history
- **DO NOT** proceed past this point without an explicit task from the user
- The task MUST come from `$ARGUMENTS` or user's answer to the question above

# Implementation Plan (Claude Code + Opus 4.5 Agents)

**About this command:** This command creates SpecKit documentation using 4 parallel Opus 4.5 agents for thorough, deep-reasoning codebase exploration before any code changes. It requires a task description as input.

**Platform**: Claude Code only (uses Task tool with Claude agents)
**Agent Model**: Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101) - Deep parallel analysis
**Orchestrator**: Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101) - Task understanding, verification, synthesis
**SpecKit Aligned**: Creates Level 2+ documentation per AGENTS.md Section 2

## When to Use cc_opus vs cc_sonnet

| Variant | Agent Model | Best For | Trade-off |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| cc_sonnet | Sonnet | Most planning tasks, quick exploration | Fast & cheap, Opus verifies |
| **cc_opus** (this) | Opus 4.5 | Complex architecture, critical features | Thorough but slower & costlier |

**When to use cc_opus (this command):**
- Complex architectural decisions where deep reasoning matters
- Large-scale refactors affecting many interconnected systems
- Critical features where thoroughness > speed (auth, payments, security)
- When exploration agents need to understand nuanced patterns
- Major system redesigns requiring comprehensive analysis

**When to use cc_sonnet instead:**
- Standard feature development
- Quick planning iterations
- Cost-sensitive projects
- When Opus verification (Phase 5) is sufficient

---

## Purpose

Enter PLANNING MODE to create detailed, verified SpecKit documentation. This command:
1. Determines SpecKit documentation level (2 or 3) based on task complexity
2. Creates spec.md (requirements and user stories) + plan.md (technical approach)
3. Spawns **4 Opus 4.5 agents in parallel** for thorough codebase analysis
4. Opus orchestrator synthesizes and verifies findings
5. Optionally creates tasks.md for complex features (Level 3)
6. Requires user approval before implementation begins

**Documentation Levels (Progressive Enhancement):**
- **Level 1** (Baseline): spec.md + plan.md + tasks.md - All tasks get this minimum
- **Level 2** (Verification): Level 1 + checklist.md - Tasks needing verification
- **Level 3** (Full): Level 2 + decision-record.md + optional research-spike.md - Complex/architectural tasks

**LOC Thresholds (Soft Guidance):**
- <100 LOC suggests Level 1
- 100-499 LOC suggests Level 2
- >=500 LOC suggests Level 3

**Note**: All plan commands create AT LEAST Level 1 documentation (spec.md + plan.md + tasks.md) because running a plan command implies structured planning.

---

## Contract

**Inputs:** `$ARGUMENTS` — Task description (REQUIRED) + optional mode override
**Outputs:** SpecKit documentation at `specs/###-name/`:
  - `spec.md` - Feature specification and requirements (ALL levels)
  - `plan.md` - Technical implementation plan (ALL levels)
  - `tasks.md` - Task breakdown (ALL levels - part of baseline)
  - `checklist.md` - Verification checklist (Level 2+)
  - `decision-record.md` - Decision documentation (Level 3)
  - `research-spike.md` - Research documentation (Level 3, optional)
  - `STATUS=<OK|FAIL|CANCELLED>`

---

## Instructions

Execute the following workflow:

### Step 1: Parse Input & Validate Arguments

1. **CRITICAL: Check if $ARGUMENTS is empty or missing**
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, undefined, or contains only whitespace:
     - **STOP immediately** - do NOT continue
     - Use AskUserQuestion to prompt: "Please describe the task you want to plan"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a task description: continue to item 2

2. **Extract task description from $ARGUMENTS**
3. **Check for explicit mode override:**
   - Pattern: `mode:simple` or `mode:complex` in arguments
   - If found: Use specified mode, skip auto-detection
   - If not found: Continue to Step 2 for auto-detection

### Step 2: Auto-Detect Planning Mode

If no mode override specified, analyze task complexity:

4. **Estimate LOC from task description:**
   - Keywords: "small" = 100, "feature" = 200, "refactor" = 300, "system" = 500, "redesign" = 800
   - File count indicators: "all", "multiple", "across" = +200 LOC
   - Default: 300 LOC if unclear

5. **Calculate complexity score (0-100%):**
   - Domain count (35%): code, docs, git, testing, devops
   - File count (25%): estimated files modified
   - LOC estimate (15%): normalized 0-1
   - Parallel opportunity (20%): can tasks run in parallel?
   - Task type (5%): implementation complexity

6. **Select mode:**
   ```
   IF loc_estimate < 500:
     mode = "simple"
   ELSE IF loc_estimate >= 500 OR iterations >= 4:
     mode = "complex"  # Falls back to simple until Phase 5 implemented
   ELSE:
     mode = "simple"
   ```

### Step 3: Load & Execute YAML Workflow

7. **Set agent model and read the appropriate YAML workflow:**

   **CRITICAL: Set AGENT_MODEL=opus before loading simple_mode.yaml**

   This command uses Opus 4.5 agents for thorough, deep-reasoning exploration.
   The simple_mode.yaml file is parameterized and will use whatever model is specified.

   Asset path: `.claude/commands/plan/assets/`

   Based on the mode selected in Step 2:

   - **SIMPLE mode** (<500 LOC):
     1. Set `AGENT_MODEL=opus`
     2. Use the Read tool to load `.claude/commands/plan/assets/simple_mode.yaml`
     3. Execute all instructions with model="opus" for exploration agents

   - **COMPLEX mode** (≥500 LOC): Use the Read tool to load `.claude/commands/plan/assets/complex_mode.yaml`. Note: Complex mode is a stub as of Phase 1.5 and will notify user to fall back to simple mode (using AGENT_MODEL=opus).

8. **YAML workflow executes automatically:**

   The loaded YAML prompt contains the complete 9-phase workflow (SpecKit aligned):
   - **Phase 0**: Documentation Level Detection (SpecKit Level 1, 2, or 3)
   - **Phases 1-3**: Task Understanding, Spec Folder Setup, Context Loading
   - **Phases 4-5**: Parallel Exploration (4 Opus 4.5 agents), Hypothesis Verification (Opus)
   - **Phase 6**: Document Creation (level-appropriate files)
   - **Phases 7-8**: User Review & Confirmation, Context Persistence

   All phases execute sequentially: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8

   **Expected outputs:**
   - Level 1: `specs/###-name/spec.md` + `plan.md` + `tasks.md`
   - Level 2: Level 1 + `checklist.md`
   - Level 3: Level 2 + `decision-record.md` (+ optional `research-spike.md`)

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

9. **Display phase progress to user:**
   ```

## Notes

- **Model Hierarchy (Opus 4.5 Variant):**
  - **Orchestrator**: Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101) - Task understanding, verification, synthesis
  - **Explore Agents**: Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101) - Deep parallel analysis
  - Claude Code Task tool uses `model: "opus"` parameter for full Opus stack
  - **Why Opus agents?** Deeper reasoning, better pattern recognition, more thorough analysis
  - **Trade-off**: Slower (~45-60s total vs ~15-20s with Sonnet) and higher cost
  - **Best for**: Critical features, complex architecture, security-sensitive changes

- **Opus Agent Advantages:**
  - Better at understanding nuanced code patterns
  - More thorough dependency analysis
  - Deeper reasoning about edge cases and risks
  - Higher quality hypotheses requiring less verification correction
  - Better at identifying non-obvious connections

- **SpecKit Alignment:**
  - MANDATORY compliance with AGENTS.md Section 2 requirements
  - Creates Level 1+ documentation (spec.md + plan.md + tasks.md baseline)
  - Level 2 adds checklist.md for verification tasks
  - Level 3 adds decision-record.md (required) + research-spike.md (optional)
  - All templates from `.opencode/speckit/templates/`
  - Documentation level detection in Phase 0
  - LOC thresholds are SOFT guidance; hooks enforce HARD requirements

- **YAML Architecture:**
  - Command file (~150 lines): Mode detection + agent model selection
  - YAML prompt (~1150 lines): Parameterized 9-phase workflow + SpecKit integration
  - Uses `simple_mode.yaml` with `AGENT_MODEL=opus` parameter
  - Single workflow file serves both cc_sonnet and cc_opus (DRY principle)
  - Modular, maintainable, version-friendly

- **Integration:**
  - Works with spec folder system (Phase 2)
  - Memory context enables session continuity (Phases 3 & 8)
  - SpecKit documents feed into `/spec_kit:implement` workflow
  - Enforced by workflows-spec-kit hooks

- **Memory System (Phase 8):**
  - Invokes `workflows-save-context` skill for memory file creation
  - Auto-generates HTML anchor tags for grep-able sections
  - Anchor format: `<!-- anchor: category-topic-spec -->`
  - Search: `grep -r "anchor:.*keyword" specs/*/memory/`
  - Compatible with anchor-based context retrieval (spec 049)
  - Fallback to legacy template if skill unavailable

- **Alternative: cc_sonnet**
  - Use `/plan:cc_sonnet` for standard planning tasks
  - 4 Sonnet agents instead of Opus
  - Faster and more cost-effective
  - Opus orchestrator still verifies all findings
  - Recommended for most use cases
