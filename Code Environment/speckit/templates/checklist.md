## WHEN TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

**Use checklist.md when:**
- Need systematic validation of feature completion
- Multiple quality gates or review stages required
- Pre-deployment verification checklist needed
- QA testing requires structured validation steps
- Security or performance review requires documented checks
- Team needs shared checklist for consistent validation

**Skip checklist.md when:**
- Feature is simple with obvious completion criteria
- Validation steps are covered in spec.md acceptance criteria
- No formal review or quality gates required
- Single-developer work with informal validation

**Common checklist types:**
- **Pre-Implementation**: Readiness checks before starting work
- **Testing & QA**: Validation during/after implementation
- **Security Review**: Security-specific validation points
- **Performance Review**: Performance benchmarks and targets
- **Pre-Deployment**: Final checks before production release

**Related templates:**
- Use after tasks.md to track completion validation
- Reference spec.md for acceptance criteria
- Reference plan.md for quality gates and success metrics
- Create separate checklists for different review stages
