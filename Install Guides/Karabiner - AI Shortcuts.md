## 🤖 AI-FIRST INSTALL GUIDE

**Copy and paste this prompt to your AI assistant to get installation help:**

```
I want to set up Karabiner Elements with custom shortcuts for AI prompting and symbols.

Please help me:
1. Check if Karabiner Elements is installed on my macOS (install via brew if missing).
2. Locate the configuration file at ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json.
3. Configure a "complex modification" rule that maps:
   - Cmd+Ctrl+1: Paste "Think really hard about this... Use ultrathink"
   - Cmd+Ctrl+2: Paste "Think really hard about this... Use Sequantial Thinking MCP"
   - Cmd+Ctrl+3: Paste "Skills Scanner" prompt
   - Cmd+Ctrl+4: Paste "Commands Scanner" prompt
   - Cmd+Ctrl+5: Paste the "Senior Orchestrator" prompt
   - Cmd+Ctrl+8: Paste "◻︎"
   - Cmd+Ctrl+9: Paste "❖"
   - Cmd+Ctrl+0: Paste "---"
4. Verify the shortcuts work by testing them in a text editor.

Guide me through editing the JSON file safely to add these rules to my "Default profile".
```

**What the AI will do:**
-   Verify Karabiner Elements installation
-   Backup your existing `karabiner.json`
-   Inject the specific JSON structure for the "Symbol shortcuts" rule
-   Ensure the `osascript` commands are correctly escaped for clipboard manipulation
-   Help you verify the shortcuts are active

**Expected setup time:** 5 minutes

### 1. 📖 OVERVIEW

This setup uses **Karabiner Elements** to create system-wide shortcuts that paste predefined text snippets. This is particularly useful for:
-   **AI Prompting:** Quickly inserting complex system prompts or "thinking" directives.
-   **Documentation:** Easily typing special symbols used in technical writing or UI descriptions.

The configuration uses `osascript` (AppleScript) to set the clipboard content and then simulate a `Cmd+V` keystroke to paste it immediately.

### 2. 📋 PREREQUISITES

-   **macOS** (Karabiner Elements is macOS only)
-   **Karabiner Elements** installed and running
-   **Permissions:** Karabiner-Elements must be granted Input Monitoring permissions in System Settings.

### 3. 📥 INSTALLATION

If you don't have Karabiner Elements installed, you can install it via the official website or Homebrew.

**Option A: Official Website (Recommended)**
1.  Download the installer from [karabiner-elements.pqrs.org](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).
2.  Open the `.dmg` file and run the installer.

**Option B: Homebrew**
```bash
brew install --cask karabiner-elements
```

**Setup & Permissions:**
1.  **Launch Karabiner-Elements** from your Applications folder.
2.  **Grant Permissions:** macOS requires explicit permissions for keyboard modification tools.
    *   Follow the on-screen "Driver Alert" or "Input Monitoring" prompts.
    *   Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Input Monitoring** and enable **Karabiner-Elements**.
    *   Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility** and enable **Karabiner-Elements** (if requested).

### 4. ⚙️ CONFIGURATION

The configuration is stored in `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`.

#### Manual Setup

1.  Open the configuration file:
    ```bash
    code ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json
    ```

2.  Locate the `profiles` array. Inside your active profile (usually "Default profile"), look for `complex_modifications` -> `rules`.

3.  Add the following rule object to the `rules` array:

            "type": "basic"
        }
    ]
}
```

4.  Save the file. Karabiner Elements will automatically reload the configuration.

### 5. ✅ VERIFICATION

1.  Open a text editor (e.g., VS Code, Notes).
2.  Press `Cmd` + `Ctrl` + `1`.
    -   **Expected:** "Think really hard about this... Use ultrathink" is pasted.
