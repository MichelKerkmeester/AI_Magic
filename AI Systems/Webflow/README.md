## 5. 🔧 INSTALLING WEBFLOW MCP

### Recommended: OAuth Remote Setup

**Config Location:**
- Mac/Linux: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "webflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.webflow.com/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

After saving:
1. Restart Claude Desktop (Cmd/Ctrl + R)
2. Browser opens for OAuth authorization
3. Authorize the sites you want to access
4. MCP Bridge App auto-installs to authorized sites
5. System verifies connection automatically

### Alternative: Token-Based Setup
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "webflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@webflow/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "WEBFLOW_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Get your token from [Webflow API Settings](https://webflow.com/dashboard/account/apps).

## 6. 🎨 DESIGNER API SETUP

### Enabling Designer Operations

1. **Open Webflow Designer**
   - Navigate to your project
   - Open in Designer mode

2. **Launch MCP Bridge App**
   - Press 'E' to open Apps panel
   - Find "Webflow MCP Bridge App"
   - Click to launch
   - Keep open during session

3. **Verify Connection**
   - App shows "Connected" status
   - Agent confirms Designer access
   - Ready for native operations

### What Requires the App

**Needs App (Designer API):**
- Creating native elements
- Applying native styles
- Building native components
- Managing responsive design

**Works Without App (Data API):**
- Creating collections
- Adding fields
- Managing content
- Publishing items

## 7. 🔌 CONNECTION VERIFICATION

### Automatic Connection Check

The system automatically verifies MCP connection before operations:

```markdown
🔧 Webflow Connection Check

✔ MCP Server: Connected
✔ Data API: Ready
✔ Designer API: Ready (app required)
✔ Authentication: Valid
```

### Test Query Protocol
- Executes `webflow:sites_list()` to verify connection
- If successful: Proceeds with operations
- If failed: Provides setup guidance

<a id="8-how-it-works"></a>

## 8. 🧠 HOW IT WORKS

### SYNC Processing Framework

The system uses intelligent 4-phase SYNC methodology:

```markdown
📊 SYNC Processing:

S - Survey: Understanding context and requirements
Y - Yield: Converting to optimal native approach
N - Navigate: Executing operations through native APIs
C - Create: Validating quality and delivering results

Internal: Full cognitive rigor (optimized workflow)
External: Concise progress updates only
```

### Native API Operations Only

```markdown
✅ CORRECT Approach:

• Uses webflow:components_create()
• Uses webflow:pages_update_static_content()
• Uses webflow:collections_items_create_item_live()
• All operations through MCP server

❌ NEVER Does This:

• Write custom JavaScript code
• Create CSS snippets
• Generate HTML templates
• Build code outside Webflow
```

### Execution Modes

The system provides intelligent execution:

```markdown
📊 Standard Mode:

• Default for all operations
• Full SYNC processing (4 phases)
• Best for complex tasks
• Shows concise progress updates
```
